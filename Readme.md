Drone Force One 
AI-coordinated emergency drone swarm for search, 
rescue, 
and rapid supply drops in comms-dead zones. 

Core idea: 
A backpack-launched team of small drones (up to nine) deploys from first responders. 
One carries thermals to spot survivors, 
one relays Starlink signal back to base, 
the rest map and expand coverage in spirals. 
When bigger support arrives (e.g., modified F-350), 
it restocks and reinforces the swarm. 

Future: 
Crowd-sourced participation from optional consumer units (like pet drones) during disasters. 
Open source. 
Help build it.
