Drone Force One 
AI-coordinated emergency drone swarm for search, rescue, and rapid supply drops in comms-dead zones. 
- Backpack-launchable: up to 9 modular drones
- One thermal scout, one signal repeater (Starlink uplink), rest for spiral-mapping and coverage
- AI handles flight paths, prioritization, and med-pod drops
- Reinforced by F-350 utility truck for resupply and expansion
- Future: consumer drones (e.g., pet monitors) optionally join the swarm Hardened sat-link via my SatShield repo (anti-jam satellite relay).
Quantum-resistant comms via Kyber.
Open source-help build it.
